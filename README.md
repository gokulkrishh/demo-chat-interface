# Demo Chat Interface

Testing out AI model's ability to create ChatGPT like interfaces.

## Prompt

```
Design a modern, ChatGPT-like conversational interface. It should include:
  - A sidebar listing recent chats and settings.
  - A model switcher to toggle instantly between different AI models.
  - A mode toggle letting users choose between pure chat, research (with citations), and web-enabled real-time queries.
  - Clear UI feedback indicating the active model and mode.
  - Personalization options for user preferences and organized conversation history.
  - Ensure smooth, accessible interactions with responsive design and attention to usability.
  - The interface should make it effortless for users to engage in knowledge retrieval, casual chat, or research—tailoring each interaction to the selected mode and model.
